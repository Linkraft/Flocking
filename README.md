Flocking is a flocking AI program that I worked on during my AI for Games class at the University of Florida. All work was done in Flocking.cs, where the program's AI algorithms were implemented.

## Usage
Open the project in Visual Studio and press 'Ctrl' + 'F5' to start the program. Use the sliders to adjust the behavior of the [boid flocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) to your desire!

## Documentation & More Information
Please refer to the 'Manual - Flocking' PDF for information regarding the documentation around the API calls used.

This project took around 2 hours to complete, and was completed on February 27th, 2020.

## Acknowledgements
Please note that the original codebase is not mine; it was created by my professor Jeremiah Blanchard for Full Sail University and University of Florida courses.
